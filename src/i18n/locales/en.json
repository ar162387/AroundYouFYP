                    "a1": "To create a merchant account, go to your profile and select 'Switch to Merchant'. You'll be asked to complete a registration survey about your shop type and number of shops. After completing the survey, you can start creating your first shop.",
                    "q2": "Why do I need to verify my identity?",
                    "a2": "Identity verification is required to ensure the security and trustworthiness of our platform. Your shops will not be visible to customers until your identity is verified. You need to submit your CNIC details (name as per CNIC, CNIC number, and expiry date) for verification.",

                    "a3": "Verification typically takes 1-3 business days. Once submitted, your status will show as 'Pending'. You'll be notified when your verification is approved and your shops become visible to customers.",

                    "a4": "If your verification is rejected, you'll receive a notification with the reason. You can update your information and resubmit the verification form. Make sure all CNIC details match exactly as they appear on your identity document.",
                    "q5": "Can I switch between merchant and consumer modes?",
                    "a5": "Yes, you can switch between merchant and consumer modes at any time from your profile. You can also set one mode as your default so the app opens in that mode automatically."

You'll need to provide shop name, description, type, address (select on map), and optionally add tags and a shop picture. Once created, you can manage inventory, delivery settings, and opening hours.",
                    "q2": "How many shops can I create?",
                    "a2": "You can create multiple shops under one merchant account. The number of shops you indicated during registration doesn't limit you - you can add more shops as needed. Each shop has its own inventory, delivery areas, and settings.",

                    "a4": "Yes, you can delete a shop from the Settings tab in your shop portal. Note that deleting a shop will remove all associated data including inventory, delivery settings, and order history references. This action cannot be undone.",
                    "q5": "What are shop tags and how do they help?",
                    "a5": "Shop tags are keywords that help customers find your shop when searching. Examples include specialties, popular items, or unique features. Tags improve your shop's discoverability in search results.",

For custom items, you'll need to enter name, SKU, price, and assign categories. Template items have names and descriptions pre-filled but you set the price and SKU.",

                    "a2": "Custom items are created entirely by you - you control name, description, SKU, price, and image. Template items are based on a shared catalog where name, barcode, and description are managed centrally. For template items, you only set the price and SKU. Template items help maintain consistency across shops.",

                    "a3": "First, create categories in the 'Categories' tab. You can create custom categories or choose from category templates. Then, when creating or editing an item, assign it to one or more categories. Items can belong to multiple categories for better organization.",

                    "a4": "Yes, you can edit item prices at any time. Go to the Inventory tab, find the item, and tap to edit. Price changes are logged in the audit log for transparency. Note that template items allow price changes, but name and description are locked.",

                    "a5": "Active items are visible to customers and can be ordered. Inactive items are hidden from customers but remain in your inventory. You can toggle item status to temporarily hide items without deleting them. Inactive items require a SKU to be reactivated.",

                    "a6": "The audit log tracks all changes to your inventory items including price updates, status changes, SKU edits, and template syncs. It shows who made the change, when, and what changed. This helps maintain transparency and track inventory history."

You can cancel orders if items are out of stock or for other valid reasons.",

                    "a4": "Yes, you can cancel orders at any stage (pending, confirmed, or out for delivery). Select a cancellation reason such as 'Out of Stock' or 'Other Reason'. The customer will be notified of the cancellation. Use cancellation only when necessary as it affects customer experience.",

On the map, tap 'Add delivery area' and drop at least 3 points to form a polygon around your service area. You can create multiple delivery zones. Customers only see your shop if their address is within these zones.",

                    "q4": "What is delivery logic and how does it work?",
                    "a4": "Delivery logic controls order value thresholds and fees. You can set: (1) Minimum order value - orders below this get a surcharge, (2) Small order surcharge - fee added to small orders, (3) Least order value - hard floor below which orders are rejected, (4) Free delivery threshold - order value and distance criteria for free delivery. These settings help manage delivery costs and encourage larger orders.",

You can use 'Auto Mode' with default tiers, or 'Custom Mode' to set your own distance-based pricing. Beyond the last tier, linear scaling applies (e.g., +Rs 10 per 250m). You can also set a maximum delivery fee cap.",

                    "a2": "Yes, you can set the open status mode to 'Force Open' or 'Force Closed' to manually override the schedule. This is useful for holidays, special events, or unexpected closures. The manual setting takes priority over the schedule.",

                    "a2": "Many shops have a minimum order value to ensure efficient delivery. If your order is below the minimum, you may see a small order surcharge added. Orders below the 'least order value' (hard floor) cannot be placed. The minimum order value is shown on each shop card and in the cart.",
